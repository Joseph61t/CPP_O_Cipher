# Overview

I am working on understanding how the same functions can be made in different situations. Here, I learned how to do some standartd things in C++. I leaned how to get input from the user, how to access a file, how to run loops, and make comaprisions between things in the file, and a given value. 

This Program is a simplified Ottendorf cipher, meaning that it reads through a file, searching for a given word, and returning it's position. This is done for entire lines of words, all seperated by spaces. It can also do the reverse, going from having the position of a word, and returning the word. This can also be done in strings of numnbers, seperated by spaces. 

I made this program because I have always been interested in other languages, and being able to go from one to another.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthroug+h of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* I need to make it so other files can be used beyond the first line. The program needs to ignore extra things like punctuation, and enter symbols. Thus being able to read the entire file.
* Make it so the program can be connected to the internet, and use a webpage for the source file.
